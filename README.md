## Contribute
In order to work on this assignment, first make sure you have Node.js and npm 
installed. I like to use a Node version manager, namely 
[nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#intro).

After you've done that, you can clone this repo and in the project's root you
should run

```bash
npm install
```

in order to install the necessary dependencies, namely `twgl`.

To view the animation in your browser, you can also start a python HTTP server 
with `python3 -m http.server`, provided you have `python3` installed. You can
then visit the URL `localhost:8000`.
